<title>Fusion Meta Model</title>

<p>
This group of packages implement a modeling framework based largely on the DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) Metamodel (version 3),
with language bindings to Java 1.11 or later.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the implementation differs from the CIM Metamodel in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ASSOCIATION classes are not implemented.</b> The functionality of Associations can be implemented using standard CLASS or STRUCTURE VALUE constructs.</li>
<li><b>OUT parameters are not implemented.</b> OUT parameters were used in CIM version 2 to return multiple values. Given that the version 3 
metamodel now contains structures, which allow multiple values to be returned, OUT parameters
are unnecessary, and cause complexity when mapping to Java.</li>
<li><b>INTERFACE classes have been added to the metamodel.</b> They enable multiple inheritance in the model, and map to java interface classes.</li>
<li><b>Object names are structured differently.</b> Unlike the standards, the {@link net.aifusion.metamodel.ObjectPath} class provides a single way
to represent all named elements within the metamodel.</li>
<li><b>CIM operations over HTTP do not use XML.</b> The CIM Server uses MOF and plain-text over HTTP to avoid an extra layer of translation to XML.
In addition, the number of intrinsic operations required has been reduced significantly, since the all named elements can be unambiguously
addressed using a uniform structure.</li>
<li><b>CQL support is partial.</b> Joins are currently not supported in CQL, so the query returns a list of instance and structure values
rather than row sets.</li>
<li><b>Java to MOF bindings are supported.</b> Annotations enable the CIM model to be derived directly from the java code at run-time.
Conversely, tools can create annotated java stubs from MOF input.</li>
</ul>

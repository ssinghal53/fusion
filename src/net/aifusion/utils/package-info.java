/**
 * <p>This package contains a number of tools, and a dispatcher for them.</p>
 * <p><b>Important</b>: Note that with the introduction of modules in Java, class introspection will fail unless the package containing class being 
 * converted is exported to fusion. This is not a bug in the tools, but a consequence of the way Java modules work.</p>

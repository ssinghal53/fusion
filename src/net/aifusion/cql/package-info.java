/**
 * <p>This package implements a query facility based on the DMTF
 * <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0202_1.0.0.pdf">CIM Query Language (CQL)</a>. 
 * Since CQL was designed for CIM Version 2, but the Fusion metamodel is based on CIM Version 3, there are differences
 * in the query language as well.</p>
 * <p> The package exposes a single class
 * {@linkplain net.aifusion.cql.CimQuery} that can be used to query instances within a repository.

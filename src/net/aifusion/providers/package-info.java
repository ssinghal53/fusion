/**
 * <p>This package contains the API used by all CIM providers, and the implementation of a basic in-memory provider. All control plane components in
 * the distributed environment should implement the provider interface for communicating model information among themselves. Intrinsic operations defined
 * in the provider permit exchange of model information within the control plane, as well as to perform extrinsic operations defined within those models.</p>
